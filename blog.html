  <h3> Assignment 0 (9/26/16) </h3>
  <p> This assignment was a little bit confusing to me at first, but once I started understanding Git/GitHub through tutorials and the help of my classmates, it got a little bit easier.  
  That being said, I'm still somewhat confused about Piazza and using the engineering site, but I'm sure I will figure those out as the term moves along. What I did learn from this assignment was some basics about HTML, how to create posts on Git/GitHub, and how wonderful of a resource the internet can be!
  I watched a couple of tutorial videos on YouTube and read through some of the threads on Piazza to help me tackle this assignment.
  Coming into this class, I had little to no prior knowledge of web development, but just after this first assignment, I am feeling optimistic and excited about learning more throughout these next ten weeks. </p>
  <h3> Assignment 1 (10/7/16) </h3>
  <p> This assignment was definitely a large leap from the first one but I actually really enjoyed it. Trying to mimic the style of the mock pages was challenging and confusing but ultimately fun and rewarding.
    Like the last assignment, I used multiple tutorial videos and websites on the internet to help me learn CSS. The YouTube tutorials were especially helpful because they walked me through the syntax of specific rules and styling techniques. </p>
