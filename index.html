    <h2>Here is a little bit about me and a link to my blog: </h2>
    <h3><a href="./blog.html">My Blog</a></h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Name: Tasnia Kabir </li>
        <li> Major: Applied Computer Science and Graphic Design </li>
        <li> Year in School: Second </li>
        <li> On a scale from 0-10, how comfortable I am with Web Development: Probably a 1 because this is my first time writing HTML since middle school and I am not familiar with Git/GitHub at all! </li>
        <li> What I hope to learn from this class: I am very interested in user interface and experience so I hope that I can get the basics of Web Development down and use that knowledge towards more CS and UI/UX. </li>
        <li> Have I signed up for Piazza: Yes, I have! </li>
        <li> A description of the most unique experience you've had: When I was 7 years old, I was stranded and physically stuck in an elevator during my dad's college reunion. I put my arms behind the handlebars and couldn't get them out, so by the time my family found me, the only way they could get my arms out was with mayonnaise. True story. </li>
